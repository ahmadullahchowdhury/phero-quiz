Basically It was a assignment project. The objective was the make a single page web page by react router. We were given a API from where we had to fetch data and show accordingly. 

In the quiz section, if you click a option it will give you a feedback immediately whether your answer is wrong or right. If your answer is correct, then options will turn meaning that you have done with that Quiz Question. 

## In this project I have used Tailwind as my CSS framework. This site is fully mobile responsive
## For icon package, I have used HeroIcons by Tailwind. 
## Third Party node package such as react-router, recharts, react-toastify are also used.
